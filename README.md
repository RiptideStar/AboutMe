## Experience

### Intern, ValleyWater Capital Manangement, April 2020 to Present
WaterValley is a one of many hedge funds in HongKong, managing billions of dollars over many future contracts and calculating trends within the stock market does require the power of computing and AI. That's when they put me in as their intern (potentially a job spot). Currently, I am still an intern getting to know the ways they implement their trading strategies to magnify their earnings and reduce their drawdowns. 
* Performing data analyses and implementing trading algorithms using Python and AI 
* Writing new strategies in python to optimize for contracts within previous data
* Comparing performance of strategies on previous data to generalize what makes up the almost perfectly optimized trading algorithm

### Technology Instructor, Tech4Kids & CFAP Youth Council, May 2020 to Present
Taught 180+ students with hands on technology projects (Code in GitHub: https://github.com/RiptideStar)
* [Python Programming with AI & Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/RiptideStar/AI_Python)
* [Game Programming Using Unity & C#](https://github.com/RiptideStar/SpaceRocks-2.0)
* [Learn Python, Web Crawlers, Website Creation & Data Visualization with Hands-on Projects](https://github.com/RiptideStar/Python)
* Psychology of Gaming & how to manage and balance it with School Life for parents and children

### Summer Intern, Nan Cancer Research Lab at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), June - Sept. 2019
* Over 400 hours under the supervision of Dr. Nan in his Lab, a leading Cancer Imaging Lab nationwide, I implemented and automated multimodal microscopy with NanoJ-Fluidics using low-cost Lego hardware controlled by ImageJ-based software.
* Basically, I applied the knowledge I learned from FLL & FTC (robotics competitions) to leverage the Lego robotics hardware to automate the imaging process based on this [research paper published on Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09231-9)

### Lab Assistant, Chemistry Lab at Oregon State University, July - August 2020
Under the supervision of Dr David Ji, I implemented the data processing program using Python (GitHub below):
